iis_komo
========

This package contains prototype code to integrate the KOMO framework into the iis_lab setup.
The code within that package depends on the KOMO code which is not a catkin package.
Therefore the environment variable KOMO_PATH has to point to the KOMO root directory.

The execution depends on a set of configuration files, located in the config folder. The sample will
only work correct if current working directory points to that file. Run the sample, using

  roscd iis_komo/config
  rosrun iis_komo komo_easy
  
Now it should work. Therefore I created a launch script that allows to do that in one step.
  scripts/run_komo.sh


Status:
=======

Class komo_interface can be used to send planning requests to KOMO framework.
Two methods are currently available - plan for position only or plan for position and orientation.


Open questions:
==============

What does the following parameters mean?
- within MT.cfg:

  transitionType = 1
  Wrate = 1e0
  Hrate = 1e-0
  timeSteps = 100	this is the amount of waypoints, the resulting path contains
  duration = 3.
  
How can be determined if planning was successful (in terms of some tolerances) ?

  - By evaluating the resulting costs, but how can they be interpreted?
  - Was there a collision?
  - Was the goal pose reached at all?

Is it possible to explicitly plan just for one arm?


TODO:
- improve trajectory execution!
- implement trajectory validation
- implement function for setting hand joint positions
- provide service or topic that allows to add collision objects
- create suitable torso model!!!

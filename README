iis_komo
========

This package contains prototype code to integrate the KOMO framework into the iis_lab setup.
The code within that package depends on the KOMO code which is not a catkin package.
Therefore the environment variable KOMO_PATH has to point to the KOMO root directory.

The execution depends on a set of configuration files, located in the config folder. The sample will
only work correct if current working directory points to that file. Run the sample, using

  cd iis_komo/config
  rosrun iis_komo komo_easy
  
Now it should work.
